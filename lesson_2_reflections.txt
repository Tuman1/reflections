What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository, I create special folders and files 
	that help me to save all history of changes. History of changes	helps me
	to more precisely understand how my project grew up, helps me to find my
	bugs more faster, and track my changes. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	Staging Area is stage of manipulating with files in WD (working dir).
	It helps to choose either file you want or not to see in your history.
	It works like a filter stage.
