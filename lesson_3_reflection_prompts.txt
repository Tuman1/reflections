When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	For more safety or for work in teams is better to use repositories in GitHub.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	As we said earlier, we should commit only when changes have a common logic,
	and represent logic change (new feature, bug fix etc.) 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Fork  is a coping repo on the GitHub servers from one user account to another.
	Clone is a coping repo "from cloud(GitHub) to local machine".
	Branch is a label that unites specific logic commits  in one chain.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Local storage gives you the opportunity to work independently from the network and have access to all changes.
